          <h2>DVM-Car Dataset: A Large-Scale Dataset for Automotive Applications</h2>
          
          <p>
            Welcome to this webpage! We are building a large-scale automotive dataset named Deep Visual Marketing Car (in short <b>DVM-Car</b>) dataset. 
            DVM-Car dataset contains images of numerous car models and the corresponding car specification and sales figures over more than 10 years period, with the hope to better support and serve the needs of researchers in various fields.  
            It primarily constitutes two sections: the <b>image</b> section and the <b>data table</b> section. 
            The shared links are provided below.

            Usage instruction:<br>
            For image selection, users can use two ways to locate target images: 1. use the  brand–model–year–colour storing structure</li> fo find car images from the target models; 2. use the Image Table to select the images from the target observation angle (e.g., front images).
            Users can use the <i>PKL</i> files to eliminate the background from the provided images (a PKL file contains the shape of the appeared car in the corresponding image).

          When building our dataset, we have carried out a small questionnaire (which involves 49 researchers in computer science and business studies), to understand the common issues faced by researchers when dealing with the shared data. As the above figure shows, we found the common issues mentioned by both communities can be broadly grouped into three categories: <i>coverage</i>, <i>accessibility</i> and <i>quality</i>.

            <!--<p>
            As the above figures illustrate, car images were divided into eight categories regarding their viewpoints.
            In many cases, background removal is required in business studies because researchers do not want the background to add any visual effects. For this reason, there are
            two versions of each image in the dataset, one with and one without the background. This was achieved by applying the
            pre-trained Mask RCNN model, through which the position of cars can be marked. Finally, due to the requirement of
            data privacy, the car number plates had to be obscured. The program shared by Mask RCNN model was used to detect the position of the number
            plate and then apply a blur effect.
