            <!--<p>
            As the above figures illustrate, car images were divided into eight categories regarding their viewpoints.
            In many cases, background removal is required in business studies because researchers do not want the background to add any visual effects. For this reason, there are
            two versions of each image in the dataset, one with and one without the background. This was achieved by applying the
            pre-trained Mask RCNN model, through which the position of cars can be marked. Finally, due to the requirement of
            data privacy, the car number plates had to be obscured. The program shared by Mask RCNN model was used to detect the position of the number
            plate and then apply a blur effect.
